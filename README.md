## About Me
I'm currently studying iOS development for a variety of markets. My two favorite types of apps, so far, have been games and finance. My first app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/just-flip-it/id1553668128">Just Flip It!</a> was approved for the AppStore in February of 2021. Not having a traditional background in technology meant beginning my development journey would be tough, but Lambda School made learning enjoyable and fast. Having previously taught kindergarten, I never would've guessed that I'd be one day making apps.
